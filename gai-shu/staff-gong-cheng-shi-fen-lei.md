# Staff工程师的四种原型

大多数[职业阶梯](https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/)为Staff工程师的工作内容定义了一个单一的，统一的期望值。有一个清晰明确的预期值对大家都是有好处的，但职业阶梯这个工具更适用于一群人，而不是具体的某一个人。这一点对于一些拥有同样名号但是工作内容截然不同的Staff工程师来说尤其如此。

我和越多的人谈论过员工以上的工程师在他们公司的角色，他们的经验就越集中在四种不同的模式上。大多数公司强调其中的一种或两种模式，而一种模式只存在于拥有数百或数千名工程师的公司。一些公司没有任何技术领导模式，而是把他们所有有经验的工程师都推向了工程管理。在文学作品中，重复出现的角色模式被称为原型，如“英雄”或“恶魔”，而"原型"这个术语有助于标记这些Staff-plus工程师的不同种类。

我所遇到的四种常见的Staff-plus角色原型是:

* **Tech Lead** 指导特定团队的方法和执行。他们有时与某特定主管紧密合作，但有时他们与两个或三个主管在一个重点领域合作。一些公司也有Tech Lead经理的角色，这与Tech Lead原型类似，但处于工程经理的岗位路径上，职责中包括了人员管理。
* The **Architect** is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area. They combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership. 
* **架构师**对关键业务的方向、质量和方法负责。ta们需要对技术瓶颈、用户需求和组织级别领导有深入了解。
* **Solver**会深入研究任意复杂的问题，并找到合适的前进路径。有些人长期专注于某一特定领域。另一些则在组织领导的引导下从一个热点跳到另一个热点。
* **Right Hand**延伸了高管的注意力，借用他们的范围和权力来运营特别复杂的组织。ta们为大型组织的领导者提供了额外的处理能力。

这种分类方式更侧重于实用性而不是完整性上。但到目前为止，我已经能够将与我交谈过的每个staff +工程师归入其中一个类别。当然我得承认，有些人比其他人更容易归类。

## Tech Lead

Tech Lead原型案例: Diana Pojar, Dan Na, Ritu Vincent

Tech Lead是最常见的Staff原型，在他们的方法和执行方面领导一个团队或一群团队。他们擅长确定复杂任务的范围，协调团队来解决这些问题，帮助unblock团队。Tech Lead通常负责团队的context，并维护许多必要的跨团队和跨职能的关系，这是团队成功的必要条件。他们需要与团队产品经理密切合作，当路线图需要调整时，他们会第一时间上线。

Earlier in their career, they will have implemented their team’s most complex technical projects, but at this point, they default to delegating such projects across the team. They do this both to grow their teammates and in acknowledgment that the team’s impact grows as the Tech Lead’s coding blocks shrink. While they’re coding less, they are still the person defining their team’s technical vision, and stepping in to build alignment within the team on complex issues.

在他们职业生涯的早期，他们将实现团队中最复杂的技术项目，但在这一点上，他们默认将此类项目委派给整个团队。他们这样做既是为了培养团队成员，也是为了认识到随着技术领导的编码块的缩小，团队的影响力也在增长。虽然他们编写的代码更少，但他们仍然是定义团队技术愿景的人，并在团队内部构建复杂问题的一致性。

“The Tech Lead role is, for many folks, their first experience as a Staff engineer. A few forces conspire towards that result. First, the Tech Lead role tends to develop early on within companies that have a strong concept of team, which is common among companies using agile methodologies, and most companies attempt an agile approach at some point. Another factor is that the day-to-day work of a Tech Lead is most similar to the work you’d already be doing as a Senior engineer, making it a fairly intuitive transition. Most importantly, an organization needs roughly one Tech Lead for every eight engineers, making it far more common than other archetypes.

“对于许多人来说，技术领导的角色是他们作为员工工程师的第一次经历。一些势力共谋达到这个结果。首先，技术领导这一角色倾向于在具有强大的团队概念的公司中早期发展，这在使用敏捷方法的公司中很常见，而且大多数公司在某些时候都尝试过敏捷方法。另一个因素是，技术领导的日常工作与你作为高级工程师所做的工作非常相似，这是一个相当直观的过渡。最重要的是，一个组织大约每八个工程师需要一个技术领导，这比其他原型更常见。

“Somewhat confusingly, some companies use Tech Lead as a title, and others use it as a role. In this list of archetypes, the Tech Lead is one approach to operating as a Staff engineer, but it’s quite common to perform the Tech Lead role without having the impact expected of a Staff-level engineer. Indeed, you’ll find non-Staff engineers acting with the behaviors of every archetype. Being a Staff-engineer is not just a role. It’s the intersection of the role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization’s recognition of all those things.

有些公司把Tech Lead当作头衔，有些公司把它当作角色，这有点令人困惑。在这个原型列表中，技术领导是作为员工工程师的一种方式，但执行技术领导角色却没有员工级别工程师所期望的影响是很常见的。实际上，您会发现非员工工程师处理每个原型的行为。人事工程师不仅仅是一个角色。它是角色、你的行为、你的影响以及组织对所有这些东西的认可的交集。

## Architect

![&#x201C;Example calendar for Architect archetype](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

“Stories featuring Architect archetype: Joy Ebertz, Katie Sylor-Miller, Keavy McMinn

The Architect title has fallen out of style in many companies, but the Architect role remains alive and well for folks operating at Staff-plus levels. Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company, for example, the company’s API design, frontend stack, storage strategy, or cloud infrastructure. For a domain to merit an Architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company’s success.”

“There is a toxic preconception that Architects design systems in isolation and then pass their designs to others to implement. That does happen in some cases, but reciting that stereotype would slander the architects I interviewed. Influential architects dedicate their energy to maintaining an intimate understanding of the business’ needs, their users’ goals, and the relevant technical constraints. They use that insight to identify and advocate for effective approaches within their area of focus, and do it with organizational authority that they’ve earned by demonstrating consistently good judgment.

“The Architect role tends to evolve in relatively large companies, companies with exceptionally complex or coupled codebases, and companies that are struggling to repay the technical debt they created in their initial sprint to product-market fit. Some companies push for Architects to remain deep in the codebase, and others set a clear expectation that Architects must not write code: both models work for some companies.

## Solver

![Example calendar for Solver archetype](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

“Stories featuring Solver archetype: Bert Fan, Nelson Elhage

The Solver is a trusted agent of the organization who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until they’re resolved. Folks in this role are moved onto problems identified by organizational leadership as critical and either lacking a clear approach or with a high degree of execution risk.

Where most Staff-level roles require a very heavy dose of organizational wrangling, the Solver generally operates on problems that are already identified as organizational priorities and thus are called on to do relatively little org-level chiropractics. On the other hand, they generally stop working on problems once they’re contained, which can create the feeling of transience and requires a soft touch to avoid infuriating the teams left behind to maintain the “solved” problem.”

“The Solver is most common in companies that think of individuals, rather than teams, as the atomic unit of planning and ownership. In such companies, it’s common to see the Solver become prevalent in the place of the Tech Lead. You’re less likely to encounter this role at traditionally managed sprint-centric companies until those companies become relatively large or long-lived enough to acquire their own varietal of technical debt.”

## Right Hand

![Example calendar for Right Hand archetype](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

“Stories featuring Right Hand archetype: Michelle Bu, Rick Boone

The Right Hand is the least common of the archetypes, showing up as an organization reaches hundreds of engineers and is akin to operating as a senior organizational leader without direct managerial responsibilities. Rick Boone compared his role to the Hand of the King in Game of Thrones and Leo McGarry from The West Wing, operating with the borrowed authority of a senior leader. However, borrowing authority comes with the obligation of remaining deeply aligned with that leader’s approach, beliefs, and values.

Folks in this role attend their leader’s staff meetings and work to scale that leader’s impact by removing important problems from their plate. Problems addressed at this level are never purely technical and instead involve the intersection of the business, technology, people, culture, and process. Right Hands often dive into a fire, edit the approach, delegate execution to the most appropriate team, and then pop over to the next fire elsewhere in the organization. The joy of these roles is that you only work on essential problems. The tragedy is that you’re always on to the next issue by the time those problems are solved.

## 哪一种适合你?

当你考虑这些原型中哪一个适合你的时候，你可以先扪心自问一下哪一种工作类型能让你充满动力，然后再考虑在你的公司中有哪些角色是可用的。

所有公司都需要能够担当Tech Lead角色的工程师，这是你最容易取得的Staff原型角色。强调个人Ownership而不是团队Ownership的公司通常会较早地解锁Solver角色；严格遵从“Sprint”或敏捷方法的公司往往较晚发展出Solver角色。在最近一批快速增长的技术公司中，架构师或Right Hand角色通常分别出现在达到一百或一千名工程师的组织中，在达到这个规模之前一般不会有这两种角色。拥有其他文化DNA的公司有的更早开发出这些角色，有的则完全没有。

要想在这些岗位上取得成功，就必须保持参与其中;了解什么样的工作能让你充满动力是很重要的。Tech Lead和架构师倾向于与相同的人在相同的问题上工作数年，形成紧密的团队意识和共同的目标。有时候，他们的工作重点是也是公司的高优先级任务，有时他们只是不知道在捣鼓啥以至于高管们甚至忘记了团队的存在。

Solver和Right Hand会在不同的领域来回切换，经常更多地与他们的同事互动交流。他们随时跟进管理层的高优先级事项，因而更有可能因为解决了领导层最紧迫的问题而获得领导认可。另一方面，虽然他们名义上是和其他人一起在一个团队中，但他们和团队的工作内容通常很少或没有交叉，他们的集体意识也很有限。

对于每一个原型，你会发现有人喜欢它并觉得它非常有成就感，也有人觉得工作令人绝望。虽然瞄准适合自己的原型很重要，但也要记住，在你30或40年的职业生涯中，你将有足够的时间去尝试每个原型。
